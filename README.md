# forecasting_time_series
This repository contains all the files used for time series forecasting of wine sales of ABC Estate.<br>
The coding language used here is Python Programing.

## DataSet:
- Rose.csv
- Sparkling.csv

## Code File: (.ipynb)
- code_file.ipynb

## Business Report: (.pdf)
This report provides a detailed explanation on approach used, record inferences and insights to analyze and forecast Wine Sales in the 20th century.<br>
Rose and Sparkling are data are from the same company but of different wines.

*Exponential smoothing models, ARIMA & SARIMA* have been leveraged in this project
